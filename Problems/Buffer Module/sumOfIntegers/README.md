## Description
Suppose you have a binary file containing a sequence of 32-bit integers, and you want to read the file and compute the sum of all the integers.  

Write a function computeSum(filename) that reads the binary file using the fs module and computes the sum of all the integers using pure Buffer objects.   
The function should take a string filename as input, and should return a Promise that resolves with the sum of the integers.
