# Description:
The project is a simple HTTP server that exposes an API with two endpoints: /uppercase and /reverse.   
When a client makes a POST request to /uppercase, the server returns the uppercase version of the text in the request body.   
When a client makes a POST request to /reverse, the server returns the reversed version of the text in the request body.   
The server also logs any errors that occur in the application.
