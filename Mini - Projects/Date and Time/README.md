# Project Description

The project is a simple HTTP server that exposes an API for getting the current date and time.   
The server uses the http module to handle incoming requests and the error module to handle errors.   
The events module is used to emit events when the server is started and stopped.   
The buffer module is used to handle binary data. The readline module is used to get user input from the command line.   
Finally, the timer module is used to set a timer to stop the server after a certain period of time.
