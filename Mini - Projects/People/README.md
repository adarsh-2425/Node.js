## Project Description
The project is a simple web server that returns a JSON response containing a list of objects. 
Each object represents a person and contains the person's name, age, and date of birth. 
The server uses the http module to listen for HTTP requests on port 3000. 
When a request is made to the server, it responds with the JSON data.
